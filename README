RDFLoki is plugin for DokuWiki which cooperates with Loki (http://loki.ia.agh.edu.pl/). It generates navigable graph which uses RDF/XML.

Simply unpack sources to $DOKU_HOME/lib/plugins and plugin will start working.

problems and issues we overcame:

data transmission PHP -> JS
autoloading script.js, not loading other scripts
including JS scripts does not always work due to cache problems /* DOKUWIKI:include_once scripts/test.js */
documentation should mention that while adding multiple JS files every file should be in separate commented line: /* DOKUWIKI:include_once scripts/test1.js / / DOKUWIKI:include_once scripts/test2.js / not / DOKUWIKI:include_once scripts/test1.js DOKUWIKI:include_once scripts/test2.js */
invalidating cache - the most painfull problem - still persists and is the most significant slowdown factor
configuration on PHP side (including i18n)
correct graph z-index order
adjust nodes size to label length
static graph generation (d3 framework creates dynamic)
zoom and pan in graph
graph styling
graph animations (enlarge nodes onhover and highlight edges)
code cleanups
Configuration on php side:

should hide "export to RDF" button if exists?
"export to RDF" selector
container css class or id where to add graph
default visibility: show/hide
Future works:

add dependency on Loki
implement configuration on JS side (already implemented in PHP) - 1. show/hide button, 2. hide 'export to RDF' button
correct SVG width to be 100% (problem with internal container)
determine on which pages graph should be displayed (config?/extra tag?)
z-index in graph
incorporate our plugin with Loki
rdfxml calls loki rdfxml generation when file is not present (optional - see below)
Future works on RDF XML generator(loki):

generate XML on save, not on click (remove all buttons and redirect page)
use configured URLs
Known issues:
chrome has problems with title on edges and onhoover in SVG
valid URLs generation can cause problems - it's wiki configuration issue 
cache problems with wiki
